    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Super-ripe cherry tomatoes make this bread salad irresistible. 
        "The key to this panzanella is frying the bread cubes in loads of olive oil in a skillet," 
        says Chef John, "which obviously makes them crispy. But the healthful fat also soaks into the bread cubes and renders them semi-waterproof, or dressing-proof. 
        The same goes for the dusting of Parmesan cheese applied halfway through the crisping process."</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups stale bread cubes (about 1/2-inch square), or more to taste</li>

        <li>¼ cup olive oil, or to taste </li>
            
            <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, or to taste </li>
            
                <li>  1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved </li>
            
                    <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar, or more to taste </li>
            
                        <li> 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste </li>
            
                            <li> ½ teaspoon minced garlic, or to taste </li>
            
                                <li>1 pinch white sugar </li>
            
                                    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
            
                                        <li> 4 leaves fresh basil, thinly sliced, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Working in batches if necessary, place bread into a large skillet and drizzle with 1/4 cup olive oil. Cook and stir bread over medium heat, adding more oil as needed, until golden and crispy on the outside, 7 to 12 minutes.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano over bread cubes; cook and stir until cheese is melted and bread is crispy on the outside but still chewy on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes more. Let cool completely, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix tomatoes, vinegar, 2 tabelspoons extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, sugar, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until flavors combine, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Toss basil into tomato mixture, then stir in bread cubes. Let sit at room temperature for 3 to 4 minutes; if the liquid is completely absorbed, add more vinegar and olive oil to taste. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
